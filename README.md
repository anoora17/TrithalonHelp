# TrithalonHelp
Athletes training for triathlons, especially in the elite categories such as the Ironman and Half-Ironman require a tremendous amount training activities.  These are often limited by the athletes schedule to be able to train, the weather for a particular day, and the resources available such as trails for running and biking and swimming pools / open swim courses.  We are chose to develop a web based application that allows the athlete to input their zip code into a search field which will bring up the local weather forecast and make a recommendation for that period of time.  This is particularly useful to users who many be travelling or on vacation and are not familiar with the area.  Based on the weather forecast, the app will make a recommendation on a recommended activity.  For example, if thunderstorms are predicted for 5am then the app may recommend to swim indoors.  It will also recommend the locations of indoor pools in a certain radius
